# Sudoku-Solver-Python-Classes-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the ninth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Sudoku-Solver.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Sudoku-Solver-Python-Classes-Project/blob/main/Sudoku-Solver.py)), which defined a Python class to represent and solve an input Sudoku board. This class initialised a 9x9 grid and methods to input numbers into this and solve with a brute force approach, following the Sudoku rules. This was tested on a trial input  board and error handling implemented for the case that the board was unsolvable. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to write the program and my project [problem solving notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Sudoku-Solver-Python-Classes-Project/blob/main/Sudoku%20Solver%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain more information regarding its theory. This enabled me to invest in my knowledge of Python classes and marked the successful completion of the ninth project in the certification.
